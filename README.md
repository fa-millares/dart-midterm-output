The rules: "Scissors decapitate Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."

in simpler terms: (1) Scissors > Paper, Lizard

(2) Paper > Rock, Spock

(3) Rock > Lizard, Scissors

(4) Lizard > Spock, Paper

(5) Spock > Scissors, Rock

(6) if same moves, it's a tie.

This is the Filipino version of the classic game we all got to know as "Rock, Paper, Scissors" or "Jack-en-poy" but this time, it has a twist with the series, "the Big Bang Theory" where they play "Rock, Scissors, Papers, Lizard, Spock" can be translated to "Bato, Gunting, Papel, Butiki, Spock."
